# tdd-express-mocha-chai
Demo project for CodeHub JavaScript 1-day workshop.
This is a simple [Express](http://expressjs.com/) application developed using a test-driven approach using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](http://chaijs.com/).

## Requirements
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## How to run
The project can be run using
```
npm start
```

You can also run the tests using
```
npm test
```

If you want to change default port: 8000 then you should modify it in files:
```
index.js and test/server.js
```
## How to use this project
This project is divided using git tags.
Each tag corresponds to a different test in a pass or fail state.
For example, `03_fail` is the tag where the third test is in a fail state.
To switch between tags, use
```
git checkout <tag_name>
```
